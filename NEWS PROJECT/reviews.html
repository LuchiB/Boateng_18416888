      <h2><u>Bootstrap 4 Review - What is it?</u></h2>

    <p>
      
          Bootstrap in general is one of the most popular frameworks used for building fast and reliable responsive websites and apps. Initially developed by Twitter over the past four years since the launch of the project it went through few rewrites, each time getting better and more popular. So it’s not a surprise that the version celebrating the framework’s fourth anniversary gets a lot of attention. In previous article I tried covering in general what has been changed from Bootstrap 3. The overall impression I got was the development team was aiming simplicity and ease in the working process. The changes seemed logical and intuitive to me and I really enjoyed the new modules and capabilities.
      </p>
      <p>
          This is when it comes to creating some web content right now, creating it from the scratch, using the vast capabilities of fully Bootstrap 4 powered Mobirise Mobile Web Builder’s Purity theme, or by adjusting already made bootstrap 4 templates. But how about when a great deal of work has already been done let’s say an year ago and a good looking and working website already takes place on the web utilizing the trendy at the time of its creation Bootstrap 3 technology? Which would be the most easy and convenient way moving on to the next level? Is it possible to automate the process or maybe use an already made tool to do it for you, since not all of us are expert coders? Since I’m generally a graphic designer kind of got addicted to creating web sites mostly due to the great capabilities and the intuitive way of working with the bootstrap builder

    <h3>PRO</h3>
    Responsive design philosophy
   Bootstrap is developed to be instantly compatible with all sizes of screens, so you don't have to worry about which device the user is accessing your site from. Yet if you prefer, you can disable responsiveness of Bootstrap.
</p>
   
<p>
    <h3>PRO</h3>
    Consistency across browsers
   The grid layout with the predefined CSS elements and JavaScript components make it easier to have consistency across different browser versions and even different devices.
</p>  
   
<p>
    <h3>PRO</h3>
    Designed to get a site running quickly
   Bootstrap is designed to get a site up and running quickly. Each of it's components is pre-configured to help with getting a site up and running quickly.
</p>    
   
 <p>
    <h3>PRO</h3>
    Well documented
   Documentation is thorough, well organized and full of live examples and templates ready for use. Every component and every part of the framework is explained and covered in depth.
   
</p>

<p>
    <h4>CON</h4>
    Large file size out of the box
   Bootstrap has an out-of-the box filesize of ~276K, which is pretty large considering it's just CSS. Most of those styles aren't even used in 90% of web pages built with Bootstrap. By only including the required styles it can be trimmed by 70%-75%.
   
</p>

<p>
    <h4>CON</h4>
    Websites can start to look the same
   If the initial Bootstrap colors and styles are not changed or edited, different websites start looking the same even if they have nothing to do with each other and they are made by different developers.

</p>

<p>
    <h4>CON</h4>
    Too many classes
   Bootstrap's over-reliance on HTML classes for styling can get very messy very quickly. There's also an overabundance of DOM elements which have a lot of classes and are more often than not nested inside DOM elements with even more classes. This gets problematic down the line because the maintainability of the project gets harder when the project starts to get large.
   
</p>

<p>
    <h4>CON</h4>
    Hard to customise
   It's quite hard to customise Bootstrap using pre-processors like SASS and LESS, the only real flexibility is with typography and colours.

    <h2><u>BACKBONE.JS</u></h2>
<p>
  Backbone.js is a JavaScript library inspired by a RESTful JSON interface that provides a VM architecture model-view-controller which is famous for its lightness and depends only on the JavaScript library underscore.js.
</p>
<h2><u>KEY FEATURES</u></h2>
<p>
  A rich API Used for programming of single-page Web applications and Web applications synchronicity. Models and Views - The single most important thing that Backbone can help you with is keeping your business logic separate from your user interface. Collections - A Collection helps you deal with a group of related models, handling the loading and saving of new models to the server and providing helper functions for performing aggregations or computations against a list of models. View Rendering - Each View manages the rendering and user interaction within its own DOM element. If you're strict about not allowing views to reach outside of themselves, it helps keep your interface flexible — allowing views to be rendered in isolation in any place where they might be needed. Routing with URLs - In rich web applications, we still want to provide linkable, bookmarkable, and shareable URLs to meaningful locations within an app. Use the Router to update the browser URL whenever the user reaches a new "place" in your app that they might want to bookmark or share. Conversely, the Router detects changes to the URL — say, pressing the "Back" button — and can tell your application exactly where you are now.
</p>
<p>
  <h3>PRO</h3>
    Its the best software for creating your business application easily and safely with all the features available in it and  if you doesn't have enough knowledge regarding programming language like CSS, Javascript, HTML than also you can easily create your business application easily from it. I will suggest you to use this app as it is the best software to create applications
     
</p>

<p>
<h4>CON</h4>
Backbone does not provide structure. It rather provides some basic tools you can use to create structure, leaving it up to the developer to decide how to structure his application, and there are also many blanks to fill.
